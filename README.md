EJS Express Boilerplate
_A lightweight Node.js project template using Express and EJS, designed to help you get started with your web development projects quickly and efficiently._

📖 Description
---------------
This project is a basic boilerplate for building web applications using Node.js, Express, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine. It provides a solid foundation for developers to create robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications. The project includes a simple Express server setup, EJS templating, and a basic CSS styling using Google Fonts.

The goal of this project is to provide a starting point for developers who want to build web applications using Node.js and Express. It includes a basic directory structure, a `package.json` file for managing dependencies, and a simple server setup using Express. The project also includes a `main.css` file for styling, which uses a linear gradient background and the Poppins font from Google Fonts.

This boilerplate project is ideal for beginners who want to learn Node.js and Express, as well as experienced developers who need a quick starting point for their web development projects. It provides a clean and organized codebase that can be easily extended and modified to suit specific project requirements.

✨ Features
-----------
Here are some of the key features of this project:

1. **Express Server**: A simple Express server setup that listens on port 3000.
2. **EJS Templating**: EJS is used as the templating engine, allowing you to embed JavaScript code in your HTML templates.
3. **Basic CSS Styling**: A `main.css` file that uses a linear gradient background and the Poppins font from Google Fonts.
4. **Google Fonts**: The Poppins font is imported from Google Fonts to provide a clean and modern typography.
5. **Linear Gradient Background**: A linear gradient background is used to add a visually appealing effect to the webpage.
6. **Body Parser**: The `body-parser` middleware is used to parse JSON requests and populate the `req.body` object.
7. **Static File Serving**: The `express.static` middleware is used to serve static files from the `public` directory.
8. **Modular Codebase**: The codebase is organized into separate files and directories, making it easy to maintain and extend.

📁 Project Structure
---------------------
The project has the following directory structure:
```markdown
.
├── index.js
├── solution.js
├── package.json
├── main.css
├── public
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
└── ...
```
Here's a brief explanation of each directory and file:

* `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, which sets up the Express server and EJS templating.
* `solution.js`: An example file that demonstrates how to use the `express.static` middleware to serve static files.
* `package.json`: The file that manages dependencies and scripts for the project.
* `main.css`: The file that contains the CSS styling for the application.
* `public`: The directory that contains static files, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
